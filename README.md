### Lab 1: Manual Calculation of DL

**Task:** Paired with your partner, manually write out the entire DL calculation example from the Michael Tayler book. This includes capturing every weight calculation (w1, w2, ... , bw4), summation, activation function, total error, and gradients.

---

### Lab 2: Deep Learning CNN with Dot Product

**Task:** Edit the neural network using the provided notebook.

---

### Lab 3: MNIST Data

**Task:** Partner up and create two models:

1. MNIST model from the Chollet book.
2. MNIST model using guidance from ChatGPT or other GPT variants. Utilize GPT for future advantage by crafting appropriate prompts and editing as necessary for submission.

---

### Lab 4: DL Exploration

**Task:** Partner up and create models:

1. IMDB data DL model from the Chollet book.
2. Three datasets of your choice from Kaggle or other sources. Each dataset should belong to a different category. Experiment with various loss functions and optimizers, and ensure to document your observations and decisions. Leverage ChatGPT to aid in pair programming.

### Lab 5: Big City Taxi Fare DL Model

**Task:** An individual lab to simulate exam conditions:

- Understand the big city taxi fare prediction problem.
- Write well-documented code, where each line is accompanied by a comment explaining its purpose.
- Implement three different models, each with unique values, parameters, or functions.
- Conclude each model with a few paragraphs detailing your choices. Think critically and justify your decisions as if explaining to a non-technical audience.

---

### Lab 6: Deep Learning Model Critical Thinking II

**Task:** Code collaboratively with your partner using the big city taxi fare data:

- Apply lessons from previous labs.
- Maintain thorough documentation with comments for every line of code.

---

### Lab 7: Prompt Engineering (Stable Diffusion)

**Task:** Dive into Stable Diffusion, a generative AI tool for creating or editing images:

- Understand and practice the concept of prompt engineering.
- Explore text-to-image and image-to-image methods.

---

### Lab 8: Image to Image (Stable Diffusion)

**Task:** Deepen your experience with Stable Diffusion:

- Engage in hands-on practices of image-to-image conversion.
- Ensure to have Python version 3.10 and install necessary extensions (e.g., Controlnet and Roop).
