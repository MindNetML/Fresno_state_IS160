### IS160 class labs

This repo includes labs 1 - 6 for Dr. Choi's Artificial Intelligence in business lab.

The labs incuded are:

1. Manual Calc of DL
2. Deep Learning CNN with Dot Product
3. MNIST Data
4. DL Exploration
5. Big City Taxi Fare DL Model
6. Big City Taxi Fare DL Model II
7. Prompt Eng. (Stable Diffusion)
8. img2img (Stable Diffusion)


lab 1. Manual Calculation of DL
  - Task:
    Paired with your partner, manually write out the entire DL
    calculation example of the Michael Tayler book. It’s
    important that you are to capture every weight calculation
    (w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, bw1, bw2, bw3, bw4),
    summation, activation function, total error and gradients


lab 2. Deep Learning CNN with Dot Product
  - Task:
    Using the provided notebook, edit the neural network.


lab 3. MNIST Data 
  - Task:
    You and your paired partner will create two models:
    1)MNIST model from the Chollet book.
    2)MNIST model from ChatGPT (or other GPT). This is
    to practice your ability to use GPT to your advantage
    for future.
    You will prompt appropriately then edit as you go for
    the submission.


lab 4. DL Exploration
  - Task:
    You and your paired partner will create two models:
    1) IMDB data DL model from the Chollet book.
    2) Three datasets of your choice from Kaggle (or other sources) DL model. Try to pick each
    from different category.
    Try different loss functions and optimizers for comparison! I need to see this! Add
    comments!!
    You may use ChatGPT to help your pair programming.


lab 5. Big City Taxi Fare DL Model 
  - Task:
    To simulate an exam question, this lab is designed for an individual.
    You are given a background about the big city tax fare prediction problem.
    You are to write out the code carefully with as many comments as possible for your boss.
    IF needed, you may create a fictitious output/result to continue your coding write up.
    You are to write the code in three different times where each time with different sets of
    values, parameters, or functions for comparison. The coding itself can also be different.
    At the end of each model, using a few paragraphs, you are to explain your choices of code
    line, values and functions why so. As if you are explaining this to your boss (i.e. critical
    thinking)
    NO comment, NO points. There must be a comment in EVERY code line. Your comment will
    be important because that proves your understanding.
    This lab is closed from other course materials in order to reinforce your memory of past lessons
    (i.e. critical thinking).


lab 6. Deep Learning Model Critical Thinking II
  - Task:
    Now, you and your partner will code together using the big city tax fare data.
    Apply the lessons you have learned so far and finish the coding with your partner.
    Don’t forget to add as many comments as possible. No comments, no points!


lab 7. Prompt Engineering (Stable Diffusion)
  - Task:
    Stable Diffusion is a generative AI tool that lets you create or edit various different types of
    images. There are text to image or image to image methods.
    This lab provides hands-on experience using Stable Diffusion and explores the concept and
    hands-on practices of prompt engineering.


lab 8. Image to Image (Stable Diffusion)
  - Task:
    Stable Diffusion is a generative AI tool that lets you create or edit various different types of
    images. There are text to image and image to image methods.
    This lab provides hands-on experience using Stable Diffusion and explores the concept and
    hands-on practices of image to image.
    For this and other Stable Diffusion labs, we need to have Python to 3.10 version and install a
    few extensions (eg. Controlnet and Roop)
